## FAQ
1. Is my account being used as a honeypot?
   - It probably is. To check, you can open our program and see whether someone has used your JDN account or not and remove them off your account if necessary.
   - Most of our accounts are fake accounts, it's unlikely that any real user's account will be used as a honeypot.
2. What does JDNService do?
   - It uses script execution in order to inject code into the computer running the Dance Room (the computer on [justdancenow.com](https://justdancenow.com))
   - This script execution is **not permanent** and will be **removed after closing the program** and/or tabs associated to Just Dance Now or JDNService.
